          I have worked with Mohit quite a few time on several projects. One thing that I like about him is that his ideas are innovative and different. He helps everyone with others work and his performance was incredible.

          We worked together on my project for Eisner Amper. His knowledge about everything was exceptional. Before working on project he did his homework on the project and came with solutions for the problems.
